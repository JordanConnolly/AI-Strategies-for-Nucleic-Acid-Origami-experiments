# AI-strategies-for-Nucleic-Acid-Origami-experiments

</br>

## What is it about
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to improve the process of designing and conducting experiments related to nucleic acid origami. The code contained within the project folders relate to code produced during my PhD at Newcastle University. Some of the code is described and used throughout my Thesis.

Nucleic acid origami construction involves the process of folding DNA and RNA scaffolds and staples into complex shapes. These shapes have a wide range of potential applications in fields such as nanotechnology, biomedicine, and materials science. However, designing and optimising the folding process for specific structures can be a challenging and time-consuming task. 

## Data Availability
Here we share code covering problems relating to the application of artificial intelligence techniques to nucleic acid origami experiments and the strategies we employed to try solve them. The data remains unreleased for the time being, but the code is available for anyone to use and adapt for their own purposes. The reason for this is potential future publication of the data. The 4 Metric GA Code and RevNano code relies on collaborator code and unpublished code respectively, so these are not included in the repository but files are included to show how the code was used.
