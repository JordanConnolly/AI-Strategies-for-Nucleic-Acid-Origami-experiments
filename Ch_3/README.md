# Chapter 3: Creation of an AI-ready data base from Origami literature

This folder contains the code and resources for Chapter 3 of the thesis, which focuses on a literature data-mining process to curate a literature data base ready for application of AI techniques.

## Overview

We have created a curated database of Nucleic Acid origami experiments, papers, text, and images. This is to inform lab protocols through the creation of machine learning and for data to use in other objectives. There is a body of literature papers that detail the lab protocols. We have used these literature papers and the detail contained within rather than do time-expensive experiments to produce a few instances.
