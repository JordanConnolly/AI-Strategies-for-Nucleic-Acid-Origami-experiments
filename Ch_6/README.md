# Chapter 6: Genetic Algorithm techniques for optimisation of Nucleic Acid Origami sequences.

This folder contains the code and resources for Chapter 6 of the thesis. Chapter 6 focuses on the application of Genetic Algorithms in conjunction with negative design criteria (unwanted outcomes) as a fitness function to generate scaffold and staple sequences. The designs that utilise these optimised scaffold and staple sequences should in theory have an increased yield as unwanted outcomes (such as staple-staple hairball formations) are less likely to occur.

## Overview

To help address the research objective of evaluating the use of genetic algorithm optimisation techniques for the design of Nucleic Acid Origami scaffold and staple generation, the published papers from a curated database related to nucleic acid origami from Chapter 3 contain sequence data (scaffold and staples used to create the nanostructures) and also contain the designs of select origami nanostructures. Generation of staple and scaffold sequences that result in a larger quantity of well-folded nucleic acid origami is of importance.
